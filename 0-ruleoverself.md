# Rule Over Self

During my time in graduate school at Harvard, I wrote down a series of private reflections and reminders outlining my philosophy for turning thought into action and becoming a better thinker. 

The way we think determines our reality, and as such, many of us are trapped in our own thought prisons. Our enemy is within - in how we think, how we act based on those thoughts, and in how we perceive ourselves and our abilities. 

As Albert Einstein put it nearly one hundred years ago: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” The way we think can make us or it can break us. *Rule Over Self* takes you on a three-part journey of learning, thinking and action.

LEARNING. 
Unlocks mental models to see the world with new eyes and shows how to understand yourself at a deeper level. 

THINKING. 
Develops more structured ways of thinking and learn how to think about thinking. 

ACTION. 
Turns thoughts into action and unlocks the keys to transform your ideas into reality.
